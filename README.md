# Used-Car-EDA-And-Storytelling

An Exploratory Data Analysis of Used Car Prices was performed. Dashboards were used to tell the story of the insights gained.

This was an IBM Cognos-based project using exploratory data analysis to understand a used car prices dataset. The report also generated 3 decision trees to predict car prices: 1. all vehicles: 81% 2. diesel cars only: 75% 3. petrol cars only (76%).

"Assignment4_Fitch.pdf" contains the text of the analysis along with the supporting figures and tables. "usedcarsales.csv" contains the dataset.
